I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind. I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more. Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again. I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGG This movie is bang average and way overhyped. phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character. I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake.
