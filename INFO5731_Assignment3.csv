0,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.\n\nthis is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.",everi onc in a while a movi come that truli make an impact joaquin perform and scenographi in all it brillianc grotesqu hunt and cring hard to watch at time but so mesmer you wont blink an eye watch it tragic but with serious funni moment emot rollercoast sometim with multipl emot pop at the same time thi is far from a typic actionriddl predict superhero movi it a proper psycholog thrillerdrama with the singl best charact develop i have ever seen,Positive
1,Only certain people can relate,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.",thi is a movi that onli those who have felt alon and isol can truli relat to it you understand the motiv and you feel sorri for the charact a lot of peopl will see thi movi and think that it encourag violenc but truli thi movi should encourag each and everi one of us to becom a better person treat everyon with respect and make each other feel like they belong in thi world instead of make them feel isol,Positive
2,Perfect in every aspect.,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.",truli a masterpiec the best hollywood film of 2019 one of the best film of the decad and truli the best film to bring a comic book so willingli and realist to real if remark direct cinematographi music and the act some peopl are surpris to find it disturb and violent but it a necess and messag it about societi and reflect those underappreciatedunrecognizedbulli peopl prove they can do someth too the way it show class differ corrupt and how rich and talent rule other around them is not exagger and that what make it differ it believ there could be multipl joke live in our societi that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film show make peopl comfort peopl consid thi a wake up call a messag but first a film a perfect film,Positive
3,MASTERPIECE ??,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime",joaquin phoenix give a tour de forc perform fearless and stun in it emot depth and physic it imposs to talk about thi without referenc heath ledger oscarwin perform from the dark knight wide consid the definit liveact portray of the joke so let talk about it the fact is everyon is go to be stun by what phoenix accomplish becaus it what mani thought imposs a portray that match and potenti exce that of the dark knight clown princ of crime,Positive
4,The Hype is real,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.",most of the time move are anticip like thi they end up fall short way short joke is the first time i wa more than happi with the hope pleas ignor the complaint of pernici violenc as they are embarrass to say the least we haven seen a comic movi thi real befor if we ever deserv a better class of crimin phillip and phoenix have deliv thi is dark joke is dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should the bad gun are alway more romant anyway,Positive
5,JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director",let me start off by say if joaquin phoenix doesn get hi oscar for thi movi then the scar should be cancel phoenix is amaz as you might heard from everi review ever but told phillip is at hi best here the stori line he take and visual are just breathtak the score org the score everi time that score came on i felt veri uncomfort like someth horribl wa about to happen it wa great the inspir from taxi driver and king of comedi are there and add so much for the movi and i got to be honest there are scene that are veri violent and it disturb but i honestli expect it to be wayyyi more violent from all the controversi go on overal thi movi wa great come oscar season it need to be nomin for best pictur screenplay cinematographi actor score and director,Positive
6,Went for a second time to watch,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.",i get whi some peopl hate thi it becaus of the polit messag and how some peopl think that you need get empti for arthur mad but come on that is not the point and it will never be enjoy thi masterpiec becaus joaquin phoenix and told phillip overdid themselv with thi movi the actingmus and cinematographi are just amaz pleas enjoy the movi without overthink it,Neutral
7,"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.\n\nJoker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.\n\nIt focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.\n\nDespite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nol...",i have seen joke yesterday at venic an earli inflat screen we had some troubl with audit that lead to a nearhour delay but it definit wa worth it joke deserv to be present at venic film festiv an event that regard cinema as a form of art becaus thi film is far from a blockbust or a mere entertain movi as most film in the gene are it focus on the psychic of the main charact as it slowli crumbl under the pressur of societi and thu joaquin phoenix doe a wonder perform earn almost sure a nomin at the scar at least it a take on the joke that differ from ledger but id say that both are equal as good the main differ might be that ledger joke is a ration that act insan while phoenix is insan to the root despit be a movi about a superhero villain joke is much superior to most of the move of the gene id exclud the dark knight trilog onli but joke is easili as good as plan move or at least veri close it is a smallscal film with a distinct style and cinematographi that can not but be appreci a...,Neutral
8,"Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight.","It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.

10,I would not call it a masterpiece as some did,,,Negative
11,"Finally, a REAL movie","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.\n\nIf you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.",thi movi caus the audienc to consid mani topic on moral particularli the poor choic made by the joke the joke is more reliabl in thi movi than antagonist usual are i think thi give a more realist view of bad peopl who are not usual 100 bad in all way as societi often judg it is import to know when to sympath with the joke toward the begin of the movi and when he need to be identifi as a threat when he begin make certain bad choic thi movi is onli suitabl for adult who are will to pick it apart and think clinic about it it isn for light amus that substanc is what make it so good if you agent abl to ponder underli theme on your own and you have to be hand all your thought to you then thi isn the best movi for you,Negative

14,Joker > Endgame,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",need i say more everyth about thi movi is wast in everi singl way joke isn just an awesom comic book movi it an awesom movi period it offer no easi answer to the settl question it rais about a cruel societi in declin joaquin phoenix fulli commit perform and told phillip wast albeit loos invent of the do sourc materi make joke a film that should leav comic book fan and nonfan alik disturb and move in all the right way,Positive
15,Critics are useless!,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong. I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie. What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role.

17,Between a 7 and an 8,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.",i thought thi film wa good but i just dont get the hope person the act wa amaz and the film wa good overal but i think masterpiec and film of the year are a bit vers throughout the review in no way did i dislik thi film i thought it wa realli good just overhyp i feel as though a lot of the 1010 review are pure base on the fact that it alreadi ha amaz review and so peopl want to carri the prais further and that it is about the joke if thi film wa releas and wa about some random guy in the same situat i dont think the review would be as high but mayb that the point,Neutral

19,OK film,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.\n\nI miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.\n\nWorthy of watching, yes. But not amazing",do not realli understand all the ten here sure a good movi good act nice shoot but the plot is not so intrigu at time it is realli long and somewhat bore i need to doublecheck the gene to see if thi is a drama or what crime drama thrill it said i would put it mayb 90 in the drama and rest in thrill i miss more dialogu more depth more substanc the plot is realli not more then a somewhat crazi person becom a bit brazier sure there is an underton in that it is societi and the system and the mean charact of peopl that is bring him down and creat the evil beast which later want to destroy everyth absolut but i think it is not intrigu stori and plot and dialogu enough to give thi a ten worthi of watch ye but not amaz,Negative
20,Extremely overrated,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.",i went into thi film expect an allie classic base on the review i had read what i end up watch wa just a decent film overal phoenix is outstand he definit did hi part but i feel like if you seen the trailer you seen the movi becaus the best way i can describ thi film is it feel like a 2 hour version of the trailer at 2 hour it a rel common aunti but it felt a lot longerwhich isn good id say thi is much more of a rental than a theater movi kind just,Negative
21,Is it great? I don't know.,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.\n\nBefore I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.\n\nAre there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.\n\nFilm of the year? Nope.",when i heard everyon say that thi is the film of the year and all the review flood in with wa i wa quit hope and excit for thi movi when i walk out of the cinema i felt hollow and empti befor i continu write let me say thi thi is not the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiec the cinematographi is excel and the act is incred that just it the sidecharact are bland and overlay dramat the plot heavili relief on plottwist and the film is so harsh that it actual fall flat on it face are there no good point though phoenix is phenomena and the score is great the cinematographi is also incred but the plot is not that great at all it even ha plot hole and scene that left me empti film of the year hope,Neutral
22,Loved it!,"This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh.",thi is just my opinion but i love the joke the perform cinematographi direct style all build a great stori and the act from phoenix wa incred he done a great take for the iron charact and now doe he commit with look the weight for the role to develop the laugh,Positive
23,"Yikes. THIS is people's ""best movie ever""?","The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.\n\nI gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more.

30,Acting Cannot Save Mediocre Script,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise.",they say it all in the write and thi is a great exampl of that good act and product valu can not save a script step in tiresom stereotyp and a failur to delv into a charact ident we meet the joke when alreadi balanc and hi call descent into mad is realli a coupl week away far from a descent it a stroll thi is not a charact studi despit claim to the contrari it a showcas of a good actor overlay contort hi bodi and laugh magic as a mistaken express of mad where is the past where are the influenc where are the conflict what are the semin moment that creat the spiral perhap if he had realli had that relationship and had it gone sour it would justifi a descent instead it a fait accompli thi is lazi write focus more on fanci long shot of joaquin phoenix danc crazi than produc someth of valu to the franchis,Neutral

There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal.

Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story.

72,Overrated and badly directed film with a misleading title,"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.\n\nIt is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a ...",joke is basic the like edit or postmodern version of fight club or the score film it lift from it interest to see how easili word like masterpiec and groundbreak are be use for thi and that is the one joke that thi movi success pull off it just a whole lot of selfseri and pour and is essenti hollow it pretend to say a lot but end up say veri littl or noth at all not about the charact nor about the societi he part of it is also joke onli in name and ha veri littl to do with the supervillain in all for a differ interpret and even an origin stori for the joke but thi movi fail to recognis or captur hi spirit even protojok doesn quit do it justic and i can think of a dozen more suitabl titl eg arthur the talent mr fleck smoker power etc intact he more akin to a less danger but also mental unstabl villain like ratcatch or calendar man though just with a clown theme and is not even close to embodi the joke extrem form of nihil it not that it ha to be a comicbook accur portray that would ...,Negative

79,I really don't understand.,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever.

83,Generous 3.,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling...

This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.\n\nThey've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement.

His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial's story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.\n\nBesides undermining every single thing that is the Joker's history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This ""man"", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the m...",thi movi repres everyth wrong with hollywood take an exist thing make vast chang to it to the point it is no longer the thing it wa yet still call it the same thing to profit off it popular thi stori is of a lower at the end of hi rope hi life wa sad pathet and he is powerless and thu cours lash out at the world for it thi is a millenni stori a person that blame everyon els is a victim there is no strength in thi charact he isn scar he isn a thing to be fear thi so call joke becaus he is without strength knowledg could never be what the joke actual is hard to kill lastli intellig and a crimin master besid undermin everi singl thing that is the joke histori it make a monkey of the batman univers thi man who ha no crimin histori can fight worth a damn and is a lower nitric can just magic becom not onli batman greatest enemi but can hold hi own against the most power mob boss and villain in the do univers whi becaus he rate the world becaus hi life suck most at thi point will have gon...,Negative
106,Well filmed but empty,"What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King o...",what can i say about it that hasn alreadi been said it not a terribl film but it not a great or even a realli good one either the technic aspect are great the score and cinematographi are realli good mani individu scene are also good but as a whole it just feel unnecessari not just that but tone deaf as well what it tri to say about mental ill is problemat whi becaus it not realli sure what it tri to say or if it even tri to say anyth about it at all instead it wa ad in there becaus well it easi right joaquin phoenix realli doe expel in mani scene of the film but in not sure i would want him win an oscar for thi overal it also just not that interest it kind of bore at time and for a joke film to be bore that a crucial offens and i guess everyon is entitl to their opinion but i serious wonder if those peopl call thi a masterpiec have even seen taxi driver or the king of comedi,Neutral

113,Clear the Shelf for the Oscars,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.\n\nPS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie.

114,As grotesque as a clown's smile,"My husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown? Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine. Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt ...",my husband and i went to see thi film and found it extrem depress moreov everyth is caricatur what could be more normal you might say given that it wa a depict the life of a comic book clown christoph woman the director of the famou batman trilog said befor it wa produc that thi movi would be useless simpli becaus when it come to horror the less you show the career it is if your told that there is a giant monster in the wood and it eat peopl you laugh and not believ it or you imagin the most horribl monster there is the most horribl accord to you what other show us is never as horribl for us as what we imagin here to make thing realli aw we sink into the worst possibl melodrama as if psychopath had all been mistreat dure their childhood mock in adolesc misunderstood in adulthood without ever have anyon to help them effect but no the vast major of them were born with a miss bolt in their head someth wa wrong in them from the start here the director want to make us cri by portray rou...,Neutral

I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.\n\nThe good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.",i didn realli know much about thi movi i hadn seen ani trailer for it or anyth but i decid to give it a go while i wa stone with my mate steve we actual got ticket for a differ movi but couldn find our screen so we end up in the screen show the joke it want til about 45 minut in that i realis thi movi is no good i couldn understand a lot of what certain actor were say it wa realli mumbl and low qualiti the stori is so confus it hard to keep track of who who there a lot of scene where liter noth happen except for peopl talk or walk down corridor i whisper to my mate steve about an hour in to see if he thought it wa as bad as i did but he had fallen asleep the good thing about the movi is the act the deeper who play the joke is veri good at it also there is a few veri funni scene near the end but other than that thi movi is overlay long too complex not enough action and poor direct,Negative

123,"By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.","Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.",now what a movi i have to admit when i first heard joaquin phoenix wa go to be the joke i wa surpris i want sure how he wa go to pull it off i wa hope it want go to be anoth chees condit full of fluff and realist explan of how the joke came to be one where my adult son wouldn have to keep nudg me to wake me up i wa pleasantli surpris on well told phillip version play and joaquin act wa superb you could feel the anguish hi charact wa go through right up to the point he lost hi mind just an excel well act movi that you almost forget is deriv from a do comic,Positive
